In week 8, I learned that WordPress: Using Underscores to Create Custom Themes:

This resource most likely leads developers through the process of building WordPress themes from the ground up using the Underscores starter theme.
Underscores is a blank theme that includes all of the necessary files and structure for creating a custom WordPress theme.
By creating themes from the ground up, developers have the freedom to create personalised styles and functionality while avoiding excessive code bloat.

DRY Construction:

DRY programming helps developers to eliminate code repetition.
Developers are encouraged to construct reusable components, functions, or modules rather than duplicating code.
This method not only decreases the likelihood of mistakes, but also makes code maintenance and updating easier in the long term.
In the context of WordPress theme development, DRY principles may include designing modular templates, effectively leveraging functions and hooks, and organising code to minimise duplication.

Both tools are likely intended to assist developers in rapidly constructing WordPress themes, adhering to best practices, and eliminating excessive code repetitionâ€”aligning with the DRY development philosophy for a more manageable and scalable codebase.
